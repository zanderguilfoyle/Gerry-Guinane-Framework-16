            <h2>Welcome</h2>
                  <p>If you are reading this it means that you have downloaded and unzipped the code for the FRAMEWORK web application. 
                  <p>This application provides implementation of login/logout functionality for 3 different user types as well as non logged in user access.
                  <p>A logged in administrator can register other new users. 
                  
            <?php include_once 'releaseNotes.php'; ?>
            
            <h2>Database - Restore and Check Application Configuration</h2>
            <p>The first time this framework is run - it runs an installer which will install a minimum database from the  (<code>/database</code>) folder - Note that DEBUG mode must be turned on for this to work.
            <p>The project also contains a folder in which you will find SQL backup of the database: (<code>/database</code>) which can be restored at any time as follows:. 


            <ul>
            <li>Using MySQL Workbench - restore the database using backup file : <code><?php echo $DBName;?></code></li>
            <li>Make sure the database configuration settings are correct for your setup - check the configuration settings in file <code>/config/connection.php</code>  </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Note there are 2 additional database backups contained in this folder - respectively,  they contain large and small datasets for the user table. The default (auto installed) database contains the small dataset. Both databases contain the same schema and can be swapped back and forth as required. 
                
            
            
             <h2>Login/Test</h2> 
             <p>This sample FRAMEWORK application supports 4 different user types along with some basic functionality:
             <ul>
                 <li>General user (not logged in)</li>
                 <li>Administrator</li>
                 <li>Manager</li>
                 <li>Customer</li>
             </ul>
             <p>When the application database is set up you will see 3 tables - one for each LOGGED IN usertype. Passwords are encrypted by default. All users login using their registered email address.<br>Sample logins are as follows::
             <ul>
                 <li>Administrator ID: <code>jsmith@college.ie</code> and Password: <code>Password1</code></li>
                 <li>Manager ID: <code>flann@gmail.com</code> and Password: <code>Password1</code></li>
                 <li>Customer ID: <code>janeh@mail.com</code> and Password: <code>Password1</code></li>
             </ul>  
             
             
             <h2>AJAX Setup</h2>
             <p>This application supports an AJAX live chat function for logged in customers. For it to work the following changes must be made to the <code>/config/config.php</code>file:
             <ul>
                 <li>Set the <code>CHAT_ENABLED</code> global variable to TRUE - Note: it is currently set to 
                     <?php  if (CHAT_ENABLED) echo '<code>TRUE</code>'; else echo '<code>FALSE</code>' ?></li>
                 <li>Set the <code>$serverIP_address</code>_address variable to point to the network IP address for the Apache Server this app is running on. This can be found by opening a command window and typing <code>ipconfig</code>
                 - Note: it is currently set to <code><?php echo $serverIP_address; ?> </code></li>
                 <li>Set the <code>$root_path</code>_address variable to path from the Apache Server <code>/htdocs</code> folder to the  <code>index.php</code> file of this application - Note it is currently set to <code><?php echo $root_path; ?></code></li>
                 <li>Then load the home page including the IP address in the URL - your current settings are : <?php echo "<a href='".__THIS_URI_ROOT."'>".__THIS_URI_ROOT."</a>"; ?> </li>
             </ul>    
             
             <h2>Next steps - Explore the framework</h2>
             <p>You should start by studying the structure of this application. You will see that the main features are
             <ul>
                 <li>Each user type has their own specific controller eg <code>/controllers/AdminController.php</code></li>
                 <li>Each user type has their own specific navigation model eg <code>/models/navigationBarContent/NavigationAdmin.php</code></li>
                 <li>Each page is identified by a specific $pageID which is used by all models and controller classes to determine how a page request is handled. </li>
                 <li>The content of each page ($pageID) is generated by a corresponding content model eg <code>/models/panelContent/CustomerHome.php</code></li>
                 <li>Login is universal - ie all user types can login via a single login link. The login model will check each of the 3 user tables in the database for corresponding login credentials.</li>
                 <li>Each table in the database has a corresponding table entity model in the application framework eg <code>/classlib/entities/UserTable.php</code></li>
                 <li>Debug mode may be set to on/off in the configuration file <code>/config/config.php</code></li>
                 <li>All forms used in this application are defined in the <code>Form</code> class which is located in the <code>/forms</code> folder</li>
                 <li>A HTML helper class is included to facilitate generation of HTML elements such as tables if required. <code>/classlib/helperClasses</code></li>
             </ul>    
                 
                 
             <p>Once you are familiar with the structure - then start by creating your own menu structures and content for your users. <font color="red"><b>Follow the 'HOW TO' guides </b></font>that are made available on Moodle where you downloaded this framework.
